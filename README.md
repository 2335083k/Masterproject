# Masterproject
Code for my masters project.

loglikefT.py contains loglikep class object which allows for easy parameter estimation. Requires numpy, scipy, astropy, emcee, corner, matplotlib and fTcosmo.

fTcosmo.py contains the cosmological functions for loglikefT.

testingflatprior.ipynb is a python notebook demonstrating the usage of loglikefT and fTcosmo.

The mock data catalogues used are all contained in the folder catalogs_LISA_MBHB_StandSirens.

There's also a notebook that appears to contain a derivation of the torsion scalar I apparently uploaded months ago. I'm not sure why it would be of interest to anybody though.
